            <summary>
            Represents formulas written in standard infix notation using standard precedence
            rules.  The allowed symbols are non-negative numbers written using double-precision 
            floating-point syntax; variables that consist of a letter or underscore followed by 
            zero or more letters, underscores, or digits; parentheses; and the four operator 
            symbols +, -, *, and /.  
            
            Spaces are significant only insofar that they delimit tokens.  For example, "xy" is
            a single variable, "x y" consists of two variables "x" and y; "x23" is a single variable; 
            and "x 23" consists of a variable "x" and a number "23".
            
            Associated with every formula are two delegates:  a normalizer and a validator.  The
            normalizer is used to convert variables into a canonical form, and the validator is used
            to add extra restrictions on the validity of a variable (beyond the standard requirement 
            that it consist of a letter or underscore followed by zero or more letters, underscores,
            or digits.)  Their use is described in detail in the constructor and method comments.

            Creates a Formula from a string that consists of an infix expression written as
            described in the class comment.  If the expression is syntactically invalid,
            throws a FormulaFormatException with an explanatory Message.
            
            The associated normalizer is the identity function, and the associated validator
            maps every string to true.

            Creates a Formula from a string that consists of an infix expression written as
            described in the class comment.  If the expression is syntactically incorrect,
            throws a FormulaFormatException with an explanatory Message.
            
            The associated normalizer and validator are the second and third parameters,
            respectively.  
            
            If the formula contains a variable v such that normalize(v) is not a legal variable, 
            throws a FormulaFormatException with an explanatory message. 
            
            If the formula contains a variable v such that isValid(normalize(v)) is false,
            throws a FormulaFormatException with an explanatory message.
            
            Suppose that N is a method that converts all the letters in a string to upper case, and
            that V is a method that returns true only if a string consists of one letter followed
            by one digit.  Then:
            
            new Formula("x2+y3", N, V) should succeed
            new Formula("x+y3", N, V) should throw an exception, since V(N("x")) is false
            new Formula("2x+y3", N, V) should throw an exception, since "2x+y3" is syntactically incorrect.

             <summary>
             Evaluates this Formula, using the lookup delegate to determine the values of
             variables.  When a variable symbol v needs to be determined, it should be looked up
             via lookup(normalize(v)). (Here, normalize is the normalizer that was passed to 
             the constructor.)
             
             For example, if L("x") is 2, L("X") is 4, and N is a method that converts all the letters 
             in a string to upper case:
             
             new Formula("x+7", N, s => true).Evaluate(L) is 11
             new Formula("x+7").Evaluate(L) is 9
             
             Given a variable symbol as its parameter, lookup returns the variable's value 
             (if it has one) or throws an ArgumentException (otherwise).
             
             If no undefined variables or divisions by zero are encountered when evaluating 
             this Formula, the value is returned.  Otherwise, a FormulaError is returned.  
             The Reason property of the FormulaError should have a meaningful explanation.
            
             This method should never throw an exception.

            <summary>
            Enumerates the normalized versions of all of the variables that occur in this 
            formula.  No normalization may appear more than once in the enumeration, even 
            if it appears more than once in this Formula.
            
            For example, if N is a method that converts all the letters in a string to upper case:
            
            new Formula("x+y*z", N, s => true).GetVariables() should enumerate "X", "Y", and "Z"
            new Formula("x+X*z", N, s => true).GetVariables() should enumerate "X" and "Z".
            new Formula("x+X*z").GetVariables() should enumerate "x", "X", and "z".

            Returns a string containing no spaces which, if passed to the Formula
            constructor, will produce a Formula f such that this.Equals(f).  All of the
            variables in the string should be normalized.
            
            For example, if N is a method that converts all the letters in a string to upper case:
            
            new Formula("x + y", N, s => true).ToString() should return "X+Y"

            Two Formula are considered equal if they consist of the same tokens in the
            same order.  To determine token equality, all tokens are compared as strings 
            except for numeric tokens, which are compared as doubles, and variable tokens,
            whose normalized forms are compared as strings.
            
            For example, if N is a method that converts all the letters in a string to upper case:
             
            new Formula("x1+y2", N, s => true).Equals(new Formula("X1  +  Y2")) is true

            new Formula("x1+y2").Equals(new Formula("y2+x1")) is false

            Returns a hash code for this Formula.  If f1.Equals(f2), then it must be the
