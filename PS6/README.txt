Hey! So i have my U=Coded UI tests working on my computer, but I am a little nervous
that they might choke on your computer when it comes to saving and opening spreadsheet
files. In the fileexplorer popup i just perform all my actions on the desktop, but
I navigate there through my favorites library. So it might give some headache if your
machine's file explorer is setup differently.
